    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Spaghetti code is a metaphor for code that is difficult to read and understand. 
        It is often used to describe code that is not well organized, or code that is not well documented. 
        It is called spaghetti code because it is like a bowl of spaghetti, where the spaghetti is the code, 
        and the sauce is the comments. The spaghetti is all tangled up, and it is difficult to separate the spaghetti from the sauce. 
        The spaghetti code is difficult to read and understand, and it is difficult to make changes to the spaghetti code.</p>
